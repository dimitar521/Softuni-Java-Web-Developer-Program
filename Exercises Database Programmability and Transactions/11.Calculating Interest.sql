-- 11.	Calculating Interest
-- Your task is to create a stored procedure usp_calculate_future_value_for_account that accepts as parameters â€“ id of account and interest rate. The procedure uses the function from the previous problem to give an interest to a person's account for 5 years, along with information about his/her account id, first name, last name and current balance as it is shown in the example below. It should take the account_id and the interest_rate as parameters. Interest rate should have precision up to 0.0001, same as the calculated balance after 5 years. Be extremely careful to achieve the desired precision!

-- Example
-- Here is the result for account_id = 1 and interest_rate = 0.1.
-- account_id	fist_name	last_name	current_balance	balance_in_5_years
